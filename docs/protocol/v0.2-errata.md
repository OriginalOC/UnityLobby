## Errata-0001 (2026-02-06): Length field excludes its own 4 bytes
Affected: all frame definitions and test vectors  
Change: `Frame.length` is bytes following the length field (total_frame_bytes = 4 + length)  
Rationale: aligns spec with standard length-prefixed framing and avoids ambiguity across implementations
